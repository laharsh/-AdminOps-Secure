AdminOpsSecure is a secure web application meticulously crafted using Mongoose ODM for seamless integration with MongoDB. 
It boasts two authentication strategies - local strategy and JWT bearer token strategy - powered by Passport.js. 
This combination ensures robust access control, allowing only authorized administrators to perform resource operations such as creation, updating, and deletion. With RESTful API support and stringent security measures, AdminOpsSecure guarantees data integrity and confidentiality while simplifying resource management.
